# Good Causes
winETH leverages the power of the PoolTogether protocol, allowing you to support public goods without spending a penny. 1/3 of the yield generated by deposits goes to a good cause.

## Protocol Guild
The first beneficiary of winETH.org is Protocol Guild.

[Protocol Guild](https://https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/) is a collective that funds the work of Ethereum's core contributors, the people responsible for developing and safeguarding Ethereum’s Layer 1. Open-source work often lacks sustainable funding, but Protocol Guild changes that by ensuring that 181 (and growing) core contributors are financially supported, enabling them to focus on critical R&D.

By [depositing into winETH](https://wineth.org), you’re helping accelerate Ethereum’s open-source development.
