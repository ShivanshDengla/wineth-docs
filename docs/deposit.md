# Use winETH

## Deposit
To deposit to [winETH](https://wineth.org/) you need [native USDC](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85) on the Optimism network. If your USDC balance doesn't show up on winETH.org, make sure you hold USDC (native) and not USDC (bridged).
