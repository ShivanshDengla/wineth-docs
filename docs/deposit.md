# Use winETH

## Deposit
To deposit to [winETH](https://wineth.org/) you need [native USDC](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85) on the Optimism network. If your USDC balance doesn't show up on winETH.org, make sure you hold USDC (native) and not USDC (bridged).

<summary>How to deposit</summary>
- Head to the winETH.org and connect your wallet
- The app will display your USDC balance. Click the "Deposit" button.
- Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit and click "Approve".
To deposit into vault, you need to allow the PoolTogether protocol to access the USDC tokens in your wallet. This happens through an approval transaction to the PoolTogether Prize Vault contract. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
- The token approval doesn't make a deposit yet; make sure to finish it by clicking "Deposit" and signing the second transaction in your wallet. 
- After the transaction has been submitted, you will be forwarded to the confirmation screen. You are now earning OP rewards and are eligible for all future prize draws.
