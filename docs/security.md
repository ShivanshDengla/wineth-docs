# Security

The contracts are deployed from the original [PoolTogether PrizePool factory](https://etherscan.io/address/0xad1c620137fa76f520f9a39daacd7b008d7d2f2d).  

This factory contract has been up for a year and half and built the same contracts that have secured hundreds of millions of dollars. 

## Audits

At least three audits have been conducted on these contracts, two of which were done by Open Zeppelin.  For more information please see the official PoolTogether documentation.  [PoolTogether V3 - Audits & Testing](https://v3.docs.pooltogether.com/security/audits-and-testing)
