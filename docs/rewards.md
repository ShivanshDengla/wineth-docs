# Bonus Rewards
## What Are Bonus Rewards?
Bonus rewards are incentives for users deposited in a PoolTogether prize vault. A bonus rewards campaign can be created by anyone and set for any prize vault, awarding any ERC20 token based on a user's TWAB.

## Incentives To Do Good
The winETH charity prize vault distributes **87,982.84 OP tokens** to its depositors until **April 3rd, 2025**. 

The current bonus rewards APR is displayed in the top right corner at [winETH.org](https://winETH.org).

## Claiming Bonus Rewards
The rewards accrue in real-time based on your time-weighted average balance and unlock weekly, every Thursday. They can be claimed from the [winETH interface](https://wineth.org/), as well as any other [PoolTogether app](https://pooltogether.com/interfaces).
